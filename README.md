## Hello there 👋
I'm a Computer Science student, balancing schoolwork with gym sessions and hiking in my free time.

- 🌲 I enjoy hiking and staying active when I’m not coding.
- 💡 I am interested in full stack web and mobile development and cyber security.
- 🚀 I aim to become a Software Engineer.
- 💬 Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about programming, tech trends, fitness, or outdoor adventures!
