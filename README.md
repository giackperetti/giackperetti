## Hello there 👋
I'm a Computer Science student, balancing schoolwork with gym sessions and hiking in my free time.

- 🌲 I enjoy hiking and staying active when I’m not coding.
- 💡 I am interested in ML/AI and fullstack development.
- 🚀 I aim to have a career in Computer Science.
- 💬 Feel free to reach out if you want to talk about programming, tech trends, fitness, or outdoor adventures!
